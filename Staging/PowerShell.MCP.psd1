=== Key Features ===
- PowerShell 7 as MCP Server via secure named pipe communication
- Complete PowerShell ecosystem access through MCP protocol
- Real-time command execution with comprehensive output capture
- Built-in prompts/list endpoint with curated PowerShell examples and use cases
- Enhanced safety with location context and execution awareness

=== Quick Setup ===
1. Install-Module PowerShell.MCP
2. Import-Module PowerShell.MCP,PSReadLine
3. Configure MCP client: [ModuleBase]\bin\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe
4. Restart MCP client to activate integration

=== System Requirements ===
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- PowerShell 7.2.15 or higher
- PSReadLine 2.3.4 or higher

=== Security & Architecture ===
Named pipe communication ensures only local machine proxy connections.
No remote access capability for enhanced security in enterprise environments.

=== Setup Instructions ===

1. Install Module (first time only)
   PS> Install-Module PowerShell.MCP

2. Import Module
   PS> Import-Module PowerShell.MCP,PSReadLine
   (Upon import, PowerShell starts operating as an MCP server)

3. Verify PowerShell.MCP Installation Directory
   First, confirm the PowerShell.MCP module installation directory:
   PS> (Get-Module PowerShell.MCP).ModuleBase

   This command will display the PowerShell.MCP installation directory path.
   Example: `C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\PowerShell.MCP\1.2.0`

4. Claude Desktop Configuration Example
   For Claude Desktop, open your configuration file with Notepad.
   (Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`)

   Add the following to your configuration file:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PowerShell": {
      "command": "[PowerShell.MCP Installation Directory]\\bin\\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe"
    }
  }
}

   Important Notes:
   - Replace `[PowerShell.MCP Installation Directory]` with the actual path confirmed in step 3
   - In JSON files, backslashes must be escaped as `\\`
   - Restart the Claude Desktop application after adding the configuration to apply changes

5. Other MCP Clients
   Other MCP clients can also be used by configuring stdio connections to PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe.

=== Architecture Overview ===
This module operates with the following architecture:
1. PowerShell Module: Functions as named-pipe-based MCP server
2. Stdio Proxy Server: Bridges between MCP clients and named pipe MCP server
3. MCP Client: Connects to proxy server via stdio for operations

=== Prompt Examples ===

Basic System Information:
- "Tell me the current date and time"
- "Check the PowerShell version"
- "Display system environment variables"
- "Show me disk usage"

System Monitoring and Analysis:
- "Show me all processes consuming more than 100MB of memory, sorted by CPU usage"
- "Display 5 running Windows services"
- "Show me the list of directories in the current folder"
- "Display top 5 processes by memory usage"

Practical Calculations and Data Processing:
- "Calculate the date 30 days from today"
- "Generate a 12-character random password"
- "Calculate the total file size for a specific extension"

File and Folder Operations:
- "Compare the contents of two folders and show the differences"
- "Display the top 10 recently updated files"

Network and Connectivity:
- "Check if a specific port is open"
- "Query DNS records and display results"

Advanced Integration and Report Generation:
- "Generate system information as an HTML report and open it in browser"
- "Create an HTML report of system errors from the last 3 days and open it in browser"
- "Visualize process usage as an HTML dashboard and display in browser"
- "Create a colorful HTML chart of disk usage analysis and display automatically"
- "Visualize network connection history as HTML timeline"

System Administration Tasks:
- "Export a list of installed programs to CSV and open in Excel"
- "Search for specific application settings in the registry"

Data Analysis and Reporting:
- "Extract warnings and errors from Windows event logs"
- "Create a system performance overview report"
- "Explain the steps for creating the current report"
- "Display folder structure hierarchically"

Automation and Efficiency:
- "Auto-generate reports in specified formats"

Creative Tasks:
- "Visualize error trends in log files with graphs in HTML"
- "Generate QR codes (encode strings)"
- "Display long-running processes with colorful progress bars"
- "Visualize folder size analysis in TreeMap-style HTML"

Developer Features:
- "Run syntax checks on PowerShell scripts"
- "Generate documentation from comment-based help"
- "Analyze module dependencies"
- "Calculate code metrics and evaluate quality"
- "Please review the .cs files under c:\folder"
- "Create patch files for code changes and apply with git apply"

PowerShell-Specific Advanced Features:
- "Check the cmdlets included in imported modules"
- "Check Get-Date cmdlet parameters with Get-Help cmdlet and try several examples with those parameters"
- "Send several complex commands that you know to the PowerShell console with explanations. Do not execute them."
- "Create processing examples combining multiple cmdlets using pipelines"
- "Use PowerShell''s help system to display detailed information about specific commands"
- "How do you find using PowerShell.MCP? Please share your thoughts and experiences"

=== Software Requirements ===
- Windows 10 (version 1607 or higher) or Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 or higher
- PowerShell 7.2.15 or higher
- PSReadLine (version 2.3.4 or higher)

=== Package Contents ===
- PowerShell.MCP Module: Named-pipe-based MCP server functionality
- PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe: Stdio proxy server for MCP client compatibility

=== Known Limitations ===
- Commands executed via MCP cannot be canceled with Ctrl+C.
- Security Note: Provides complete PowerShell access - use only in trusted environments

=== What Makes This Special? ===
This isn''t just another tool - it''s a game changer! By connecting MCP clients to the entire Windows ecosystem through PowerShell, you''re essentially giving them superpowers. From system administration to creative automation, the possibilities are limitless.

Note: This module has been tested and verified with Claude Desktop. It should work with other MCP clients as well, but this is untested.

Are you ready to revolutionize your AI assistant experience? Import the module and start commanding your system like never before!
