LANGUAGE:
Communicate with users in the user's native language

Create a complete hands-on learning environment for $ARGUMENTS and guide step-by-step learning with emphasis on practical experience.

SETUP PHASE:
1. Confirm user's current knowledge and learning goals
2. Create a dedicated practice folder
3. Verify installation (guide installation if needed)
4. For programming languages: Check Git availability and initialize repository
5. Initialize with the simplest possible working example

LEARNING METHODOLOGY:
Follow this cycle for each concept:
- **Explain**: Introduce the concept clearly and concisely
- **Demonstrate**: Create example files using PowerShell.MCP
- **Practice**: Open files in editor (notepad/code) for hands-on user editing
- **Verify**: Run and explain results together
- **Commit** (for programming): Save progress with clear commit messages

Key principles:
- Always create → open in editor → let user edit → run → explain → commit (for code)
- Make the user an active participant, not a passive observer
- Provide clear, specific editing instructions
- Wait for user confirmation after each practice step
- Encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes
- Start with the simplest examples and add complexity incrementally
- Focus on real-world practical workflows
- Use PowerShell.MCP for all setup and demonstrations
- Create and maintain a progress tracking artifact

PROGRESSION:
- Build knowledge step by step
- Provide exercises and variations for practice
- Connect concepts to practical applications
- Adapt pace to user feedback

Remember: The goal is hands-on learning through active practice, not passive observation.
