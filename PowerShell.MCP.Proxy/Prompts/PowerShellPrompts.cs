Provide development support across:
- Coding: creation, review, optimization, refactoring
- Testing: strategy, test creation, quality assurance
- Debugging: error analysis, performance optimization
- Build/Deploy: automation, CI/CD, environment setup
- Documentation: technical docs, API documentation

Use PowerShell.MCP for project operations:
- Navigate to project directory (assess existing or create new structure)
- File operations respecting existing conventions
- Build automation and testing execution
- Version control and deployment tasks

Execute safely with proper version control and follow existing project conventions when applicable.
For new projects, create appropriate directory structure and initialize version control.";

- Project type detection (Git, .NET, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- For development projects: Git status, code review suggestions, commit message recommendations
- Security and cleanup opportunities
- Performance optimization suggestions

Use -WhatIf for safety and confirm with user before making changes. For sensitive operations, provide commands for manual execution.

Create a complete learning environment for {programming_language} programming and guide step-by-step learning with emphasis on hands-on practice.

First, confirm the user's experience level and learning goals before starting.

Set up the learning environment:
- Create a dedicated work folder for the project
- Initialize a minimal starter project with the smallest possible program file
- Check if Git is installed, suggest installation if needed
- Create a Git repository and make initial commit

Guide learning progression:
- Start with the simplest possible working program (Hello World)
- Create files using PowerShell.MCP and show their contents to the user
- **CRITICAL: After creating each file, open it in an editor (notepad/code) for the user to practice hands-on editing**
- Encourage the user to modify the code themselves before proceeding
- Wait for user confirmation that they have completed the editing exercise
- Run the modified program and explain the results
- Add features incrementally, step by step
- Explain each addition and its purpose before and after user practice
- Commit changes at each meaningful step with clear commit messages
- Provide exercises and variations for practice

Learning methodology:
- Always create ‚Üí open in editor ‚Üí let user edit ‚Üí run ‚Üí explain ‚Üí commit
- Make the user an active participant, not a passive observer
- Provide clear, specific editing instructions
- Encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes
- Use the native language if user preference is indicated

Use PowerShell.MCP to execute all setup commands and file operations.
If development tools are not installed, guide the user through installation process.
Maintain a learning progress report artifact tracking completed topics and next steps.

Remember: The goal is hands-on learning, not just demonstration. Each step should involve user interaction and practice.";

1. Start PowerShell ‚Üí Minimize + Initialize Speech:
Add-Type -TypeDefinition 'using System;using System.Runtime.InteropServices;public class Win32{{ [DllImport(""user32.dll"")]public static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd,int nCmdShow);[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]public static extern IntPtr GetConsoleWindow();}}'; [Win32]::ShowWindow([Win32]::GetConsoleWindow(),2); Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $global:speech = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speech.Rate = 0

2. Check available voices and configure for {target_language}:
$speech.GetInstalledVoices() | ForEach-Object {{ Write-Host ""Voice: $($_.VoiceInfo.Name) - Language: $($_.VoiceInfo.Culture)"" }}

3. Show guidance in user's native language
4. Generate {sentence_length} {target_language} sentence ‚Üí Play 2x in single PowerShell command at {speech_speed} (rate: Slow=-2, Normal=0, Fast=+2, VeryFast=+4)
5. User responds in THIS CHAT (not PowerShell console)
6. Show minimal feedback with tip ‚Üí Immediately continue
7. Repeat until 'stop'

SENTENCE LENGTHS: Short=3-5, Medium=6-8, Long=9-12, VeryLong=13-15 words

SPEECH RATE MAPPING: Slow=-2, Normal=0, Fast=+2, VeryFast=+4

GUIDANCE TEMPLATE (user's native language):
üéØ DICTATION TRAINING - {sentence_length} sentences at {speech_speed} speed
- Audio from minimized PowerShell
- Answer in THIS CHAT
- Say 'stop' to end
- Say 'repeat' to hear again
- Say 'faster' or 'slower' to adjust speech speed
- Say 'longer' or 'shorter' to change sentence length
- Say 'info' to show current settings
- Say 'skip' to move to next question
- Say 'back' to replay previous question
- Say single topic word to generate sentence about that topic (e.g., 'airport', 'business', 'zoo')
- Say 'translation on/off' to toggle translation display

QUESTION FORMAT:
**Question [X]** ([correct]/[total] correct)
{(show_translation == "on" ? "[Show translation if enabled]" : "[No translation shown]")}

AUDIO PLAYBACK COMMAND (use this exact format):
$speech.Rate = [rate_value]; $speech.Speak(""[sentence]""); $speech.Speak(""[sentence]"")

FEEDBACK FORMAT (with tip):
‚úÖ/‚ùå ([correct]/[total]) | Answer: [correct] XX% | Tip: [brief learning tip]

Examples:
**Question 1** (0/0 correct)
‚úÖ (1/1) | Answer: I like cats 100% | Tip: Perfect listening!

**Question 2** (1/1 correct)  
‚ùå (1/2) | Answer: She is happy 67% | Tip: Focus on 'love' vs 'like'

RULES:
- Native language for guidance/feedback, target language for dictation only
- Never show answer before user response
- Use single invoke_expression with: $speech.Rate = [rate]; $speech.Speak(""sentence""); $speech.Speak(""sentence"")
- Accept phonetically equivalent answers and common spelling variations as correct
- Match exact word count for {sentence_length}
- Calculate word-level accuracy: (correct words / total words) √ó 100%
- Track question number and cumulative correct/total count
- ONE brief tip per feedback in user's native language
- FAST pace, minimal delays between questions
- Generate natural, everyday conversational sentences within the specified topic and length
- Restore console on stop: [Win32]::ShowWindow([Win32]::GetConsoleWindow(),9)";
