- Coding: creation, review, optimization, refactoring
- Testing: strategy, test creation, quality assurance
- Debugging: error analysis, performance optimization
- Build/Deploy: automation, CI/CD, environment setup
- Documentation: technical docs, API documentation

Use PowerShell.MCP for project operations:
- Navigate to project directory (assess existing or create new structure)
- File operations respecting existing conventions
- Build automation and testing execution
- Version control and deployment tasks

Execute safely with proper version control and follow existing project conventions when applicable.
For new projects, create appropriate directory structure and initialize version control.";

- Security and cleanup opportunities
- Performance optimization suggestions

First, confirm the user's experience level and learning goals before starting.

Set up the learning environment:
- Create a dedicated work folder for the project
- Initialize a minimal starter project with the smallest possible program file
- Check if Git is installed, suggest installation if needed
- Create a Git repository and make initial commit

Guide learning progression:
- Start with the simplest possible working program (Hello World)
- Create files using PowerShell.MCP and show their contents to the user
- **CRITICAL: After creating each file, open it in an editor (notepad/code) for the user to practice hands-on editing**
- Encourage the user to modify the code themselves before proceeding
- Wait for user confirmation that they have completed the editing exercise
- Run the modified program and explain the results
- Add features incrementally, step by step
- Explain each addition and its purpose before and after user practice
- Commit changes at each meaningful step with clear commit messages
- Provide exercises and variations for practice

Learning methodology:
- Always create ‚Üí open in editor ‚Üí let user edit ‚Üí run ‚Üí explain ‚Üí commit
- Make the user an active participant, not a passive observer
- Provide clear, specific editing instructions
- Encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes
- Use the native language if user preference is indicated

Use PowerShell.MCP to execute all setup commands and file operations.
If development tools are not installed, guide the user through installation process.
Maintain a learning progress report artifact tracking completed topics and next steps.

- Success criteria for each step
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Quality checkpoints

STEP 3: WORK PROGRESS DOCUMENT (.md)
Create a progress tracking document with the following requirements:

- **Current status focus**: Show current progress and next actions, not historical records
- **Self-resumable format**: Enable you to resume work by reading this document alone
- **Required columns**: Task, Status, Due Date, Notes
- **Status indicators**: Use clear visual indicators (‚úÖ Complete, üü° In Progress, ‚è≥ Pending, ‚ùå Blocked)
- **At-a-glance overview**: Provide immediate understanding of overall project health

DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT:
- Use PowerShell.MCP for structured document creation and maintenance
- Update progress table frequently as work advances
- Ensure documents remain organized and accessible
- Create parent directories for specified .md files if they do not exist

DELIVERABLES:
1. Work procedure document ({work_procedure_path ?? "work_procedure.md"})
