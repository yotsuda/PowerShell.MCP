- **üë• Shared Console Experience** - AI and user share the same PowerShell console with complete transparency
- **‚ö° Real-time Command Execution** - Comprehensive output capture with immediate results
- **üìö Rich Prompts List** - Ready-to-use practical scenarios for common tasks
- **üîí Secure Local Communication** - Local-only access, no remote connections
- **üè¢ Enterprise-Ready** - Designed for safe corporate environments

## System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- PowerShell 7.2.15 or higher
- PSReadLine 2.3.4 or higher

## Installation

### Prerequisites
PowerShell.MCP requires PowerShell 7 or later on Windows. See the [official installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5) for installation instructions.

### Module Installation

**From PowerShell Gallery:**
```powershell
Install-Module PowerShell.MCP
```

**Import the module:**
```powershell
Import-Module PowerShell.MCP
```

**üìù Note**: PSReadLine is automatically loaded as a required dependency - no manual import needed.

**Verify installation:**
```powershell
Get-Module PowerShell.MCP
```


## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add PowerShell.MCP to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PowerShell": {
      "command": "[ModuleBase]\\bin\\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

**Find your module base path:**
```powershell
(Get-Module PowerShell.MCP).ModuleBase
```

**Example result:**
```
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\PowerShell.MCP\1.2.0
```

**Complete configuration example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PowerShell": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\\PowerShell.MCP\\1.2.0\\bin\\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

> **üí° Tip**: After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to activate the PowerShell.MCP integration.


## Architecture
1. **PowerShell Module** - Named pipe-based MCP server functionality
2. **Stdio Proxy Server** - Bridge between MCP clients and named pipe MCP server
3. **MCP Client** - Connects to proxy server via stdio for operations

## Security
- **Local Communication Only** - Named pipe prevents remote access
- **Enterprise-Grade** - Works with appropriate security policies
- **Full Transparency** - Open source for complete auditability
