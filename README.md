## Security Warning
**This module provides complete PowerShell access to your system.**  
Malicious use could result in severe damage. Use responsibly and only in trusted environments.

## Overview

PowerShell.MCP is a tool that enables AI assistants (such as Claude Desktop) to execute any cmdlets/CLI tools within a PowerShell console. Users can also execute cmdlets/CLI tools in the same console, allowing AI and users to work collaboratively. It operates at high speed without needing to launch a new console each time, while preserving the state of imported modules, functions and variables.

### What Makes It Powerful

**ü§ù Shared Console Experience**
- You and AI work together in the same PowerShell session
- Every command the AI executes appears in your console in real-time
- PowerShell cmdlets display colorful output
- You can respond to input requests from AI-executed commands directly in the console
- You can run your own commands between AI operations
- AI-executed commands are saved to history, allowing you to recall and modify parameters for re-execution
- Complete transparency - see exactly what's happening

**üîÑ Living Workspace That Remembers Everything**
- Current directory persists across all commands and interactions
- Imported modules and authenticated sessions remain active throughout the entire session
- Variables, functions, and mounted drives stay available throughout the session
- No need to re-initialize or re-authenticate between commands
- True model context protocol implementation preserves your entire working state

**‚ö° Instant Response, Zero Overhead**
- Commands execute immediately without launching new PowerShell processes
- Eliminates the typical 1-5 second startup delay per cmdlet
- Fast initial feedback to users with instant acknowledgment before full results
- Real-time streaming of output as commands run
- Complex multi-step operations flow naturally

**üîç Comprehensive Output Stream Capture**
- Command output is captured and returned to the AI assistant, with PowerShell's critical streams (error, warning, success, information) completely separated
- Verbose and debug streams display naturally in the console under user control, and can be shared manually when needed
- Clear execution statistics for every command: duration, error count, warning count, and info count

**üìù LLM-Optimized Text File Operations**
- Traditional Get/Set-Content cmdlets frequently fail for LLMs due to line number confusion and poor performance
- To address this, PowerShell.MCP includes 6 specialized cmdlets designed specifically for AI assistants to handle text file operations reliably
- Single-pass processing architecture enables up to 100x faster performance than Get/Set-Content on large files
- 1-based line numbering eliminates array index confusion and matches compiler error messages
- Automatic encoding detection and preservation (UTF-8/16/32, Shift-JIS, line endings)
- Pattern matching with regex support and capture groups

**üîó PowerShell Pipeline Composability**
- PowerShell naturally chains commands together, passing rich data between them
- AI assistants leverage this composability to build sophisticated workflows from simple building blocks
- Example: "Show me the top 5 largest log files" becomes `Get-ChildItem *.log | sort Length -Descending | select -First 5`
- Unlike approaches that expose each cmdlet/CLI tool as individual MCP tools, PowerShell.MCP enables AI to freely combine any commands into flexible pipelines
- You describe what you want in natural language - AI constructs the optimal pipeline automatically
- No need to understand pipeline syntax yourself - just tell AI what you need

**üåê Universal Modules & CLI Tools Integration**
- PowerShell.MCP acts as a universal bridge, instantly making any PowerShell modules or CLI tools available as fully functional MCP servers
- Access the vast ecosystem of PowerShell Gallery with over 3,000 pre-built modules, instantly integrating with everything from cloud services like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud to enterprise tools like Active Directory, Exchange, SQL Server, and Kubernetes
- Uses `Get-Help` to automatically learn each cmdlet's syntax, parameters, and usage patterns for immediate productive use
- AI effectively leverages well-known command-line tools like Git or Docker
- PowerShell.MCP fundamentally transforms the MCP ecosystem by making virtually any command-line tool AI-accessible without custom development

**üìö No RAG or Context Grounding Required**
- Simply gather necessary documents and files in a folder
- Tell the AI assistant "Check this folder" in your prompt
- AI instantly accesses all the knowledge needed for the task
- Works with any content: documentation, project templates, code samples, configurations, and more
- No need for complex RAG systems or context grounding infrastructure
- Natural and intuitive way to provide domain-specific knowledge to AI

**üéØ Ready-to-Use Built-in Prompts**
- 8 specialized prompts for development, analysis, administration, and learning scenarios
- Intelligent automation with native language support and interactive guidance
- Built-in safety measures, progress tracking, and hands-on learning environments
- Accessible directly through MCP client prompts list - no command writing required

**üîê Enterprise-Ready Security**
- Local-only communication through named pipes
- No network exposure or remote connections
- Every executed command is visible and auditable
- Compatible with strict corporate security policies

### See It In Action
```text
# AI navigates to your project
PS C:\> cd C:\MyProject\WebApp

# All subsequent commands inherit this context automatically
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> dir *.js               # Lists JS files
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> git status             # Shows git status  
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> dotnet build           # Builds the project
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> $env:NODE_ENV = "dev"  # Sets variable
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> ./scripts/deploy.ps1   # Runs scripts with env vars intact

# PowerShell pipeline example - objects flow through each stage
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> Get-ChildItem *.log | 
    where Length -gt 1MB | 
    sort LastWriteTime -Descending | 
    select Name, Length, LastWriteTime
```

Transform natural language requests into PowerShell automation - from simple file operations to complex system administration tasks, all while maintaining complete visibility and control.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- Claude Desktop ([download](https://claude.ai/download)) or any MCP clients
  - **Note: Claude Desktop is strongly recommended** as other clients may not deliver optimal performance
- PowerShell 7.2.15 or higher ([installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5))
- PSReadLine 2.3.4 or higher ([auto-installed](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadLine))

### 1. Open PowerShell 7
- Press `Win + R`, type `pwsh`, press `Enter`
- Verify PowerShell 7.x is running (not Windows PowerShell 5.x)

### 2. Install PowerShell.MCP
```powershell
Install-Module PowerShell.MCP
Import-Module PowerShell.MCP
```

### 3. Get your module path
```powershell
(Get-Module PowerShell.MCP).ModuleBase
# Example output: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\PowerShell.MCP\1.2.7
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PowerShell": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\\PowerShell.MCP\\1.2.7\\bin\\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop and test
- Restart Claude Desktop to activate the integration
- See the **Examples** section below for your first demo!

## Limitations
- **AI Command Cancellation**: Commands executed by AI assistants cannot be cancelled with Ctrl+C. To cancel AI-executed commands, close the PowerShell console
- **User Command Privacy**: Commands executed by users are not visible to AI assistants
