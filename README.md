## Security Warning
**This module provides complete PowerShell access to your system.**  
Malicious use could result in severe damage. Use responsibly and only in trusted environments.

## Overview

PowerShell.MCP is a tool that enables AI assistants (such as Claude Desktop) to execute any cmdlets/CLI tools within a PowerShell console. Users can also execute cmdlets/CLI tools in the same console, allowing AI and users to work collaboratively. It operates at high speed without needing to launch a new console each time, while preserving the state of imported modules, functions and variables.

### What Makes It Powerful

**ü§ù Shared Console Experience**
- You and AI work together in the same PowerShell session
- Every command the AI executes appears in your console in real-time
- Run your own commands between AI operations
- Complete transparency - see exactly what's happening

**üîÑ Living Workspace That Remembers Everything**
- Current directory persists across all commands and interactions
- Imported modules and authenticated sessions remain active throughout the entire session
- Variables, functions, and mounted drives stay available throughout the session
- No need to re-initialize or re-authenticate between commands
- True model context protocol implementation preserves your entire working state

**‚ö° Instant Response, Zero Overhead**
- Commands execute immediately without launching new PowerShell processes
- Eliminates the typical 1-5 second startup delay per command
- Fast initial feedback to users with instant acknowledgment before full results
- Real-time streaming of output as commands run
- Complex multi-step operations flow naturally

**üîê Enterprise-Ready Security**
- Local-only communication through named pipes
- No network exposure or remote connections
- Every executed command is visible and auditable
- Compatible with strict corporate security policies

### See It In Action
```text
# AI navigates to your project
PS C:\> cd C:\MyProject\WebApp

# All subsequent commands inherit this context automatically
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> dir *.js               # Lists JS files
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> git status             # Shows git status  
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> dotnet build           # Builds the project
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> $env:NODE_ENV = "dev"  # Sets variable
PS C:\MyProject\WebApp> ./scripts/deploy.ps1   # Runs scripts with env vars intact
```

Transform natural language requests into PowerShell automation - from simple file operations to complex system administration tasks, all while maintaining complete visibility and control.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- Claude Desktop ([download](https://claude.ai/download)) or any MCP clients
- PowerShell 7.2.15 or higher ([installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5))
- PSReadLine 2.3.4 or higher ([auto-installed](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadLine))

### 1. Open PowerShell 7
- Press `Win + R`, type `pwsh`, press `Enter`
- Verify PowerShell 7.x is running (not Windows PowerShell 5.x)

### 2. Install PowerShell.MCP
```powershell
Install-Module PowerShell.MCP
Import-Module PowerShell.MCP
```

### 3. Get your module path
```powershell
(Get-Module PowerShell.MCP).ModuleBase
# Example output: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\PowerShell.MCP\1.2.0
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PowerShell": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\\PowerShell.MCP\\1.2.0\\bin\\PowerShell.MCP.Proxy.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop and test
- Restart Claude Desktop to activate the integration
- Try: "Show me the PowerShell version"

**üí° First-time tip**: Start with simple commands to familiarize yourself with the shared console experience.

## Limitations
- **AI Command Cancellation**: Commands executed by AI assistants cannot be cancelled with Ctrl+C. To cancel AI-executed commands, close the PowerShell console
- **User Command Privacy**: Commands executed by users are not visible to AI assistants

## Examples

PowerShell.MCP provides **8 carefully curated built-in prompts** accessible directly from MCP clients through the prompts list feature. Try them out!

### üí° Getting Started Tips
1. **Start Simple**: Try basic system information commands first
2. **Explore Built-in Prompts**: Use the 8 curated prompts in your MCP client
3. **Build Complexity**: Progress from single commands to pipelines
4. **Learn by Doing**: Ask AI to explain what each command does
5. **Stay Safe**: Test in non-production environments first

### üé≠ Interactive Experience
PowerShell.MCP transforms your AI assistant into a powerful system administrator. Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: "I need to see which processes are using the most memory"
Assistant: I'll show you the top memory-consuming processes...
[Executes: Get-Process | Sort-Object WorkingSet -Descending | Select-Object -First 10]
[Results appear in real-time with explanation]
```
