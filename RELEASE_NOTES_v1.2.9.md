# Text Deletion and Architecture Improvements

This release introduces text deletion capabilities through empty replacement strings and improves the module architecture with IModuleAssemblyInitializer.

## ‚ú® What's New

### **üóëÔ∏è Text Deletion with Empty Replacement**

You can now delete text by using an empty string for the `-Replacement` parameter in `Update-MatchInFile`:

```powershell
# Remove port numbers from configuration
Update-MatchInFile config.txt -Contains ":8080" -Replacement ""

# Delete all digits from a string
Update-MatchInFile data.txt -Pattern '\d+' -Replacement ""

# Clean up debug statements
Update-MatchInFile app.log -Contains "DEBUG " -Replacement ""
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Simple text removal without complex regex
- Works with both `-Contains` (literal) and `-Pattern` (regex) modes
- Preserves file encoding and newlines

---

### **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Refactoring**

The module initialization has been modernized from `CmdletProvider` to `IModuleAssemblyInitializer`:

**Benefits:**
- Improved module loading performance
- Better PowerShell 7+ compatibility
- Cleaner initialization architecture
- Reduced memory footprint

*Note: This is an internal change with no impact on cmdlet usage.*

### **üó∫Ô∏è Built-in Interactive Map Prompt**

New MCP custom prompt that automatically creates interactive maps - no PowerShell.Map knowledge required:

**Usage:**
Simply tell Claude what you want to see:
```
"Create a map of famous temples in Kyoto with PowerShell.Map module"
"Show me hot springs in Hakone area"
"Map popular ramen shops in Tokyo"
```

**That's it!** Claude automatically:
- Researches and validates locations
- Creates color-coded markers with emoji labels
- Displays the interactive map
- Offers an automated tour of all spots

**Example Themes:**
- Hot springs (‚ô®Ô∏è), Ramen shops (üçú), Tourist spots (temples‚õ©Ô∏è, museumsüèõÔ∏è, parksüå≥)

**Key Benefits:**
- No need to learn PowerShell.Map commands
- Automatic coordinate validation
- Beautiful emoji-enhanced maps
- Interactive tour feature
- Map opens automatically at http://localhost:8765/

## üí° Usage Examples

### Text Deletion

# Remove sensitive data
Update-MatchInFile secrets.txt -Pattern 'API_KEY=\S+' -Replacement ""

# Clean up log files

# Remove comments from code
Update-MatchInFile script.ps1 -Pattern '#.*$' -Replacement ""
```

### Combined Operations
```powershell
# Remove old entries and add new ones
Update-MatchInFile config.ini -Contains "old_setting=" -Replacement ""
Add-LinesToFile config.ini -Content "new_setting=value"
```
